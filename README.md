# Running-Average
Often times when asked for an average of a sequence of values, we tend to initialize a variable that stores the sum of the sequences of values. The problem with this is that, the initialized variable might not be able to hold the value due to limitations with respect to memory alocation. We might be able to say the same about the counter variable that we often update, but we know for sure that this sum variable will "break" before the counter. 
The way to solve this issue is by creating a "Running-Average."
